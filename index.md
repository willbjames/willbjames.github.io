## Iola Walker Project

In music, hemiola rhythms are propulsion-generating rhythmic pulses that act as a mechanism of rhythmic tension. For example, when a song is in 4/4 time, a hemiola in dotted quarter notes might help generate excitement according to principles of musical tension and release. Often, a person will listen to music while walking purposefully to their next destination, or take a walk while listening to music in order to relax. Musicians record songs with an iola walking listener in mind, imagining typical walking paces when they play improvised parts and incorporating those pulses. Several versions of the same song are recorded with varying underlying hemiola pulses.

A person goes for a walk, and Iola Walker detects their walking pace. It then chooses, for the next section of a song, the version with hemiola rhythms closest to the listenerâ€™s walking pace. Iola Walker picks up footfalls using a foot-mounted IMU:

and outputs MIDI messages that can be consumed by a VST3 plugin:
