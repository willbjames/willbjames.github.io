## Part 1: Iola Walker

In music, polyrhythms are propulsion-generating overlaid figures prescribed according to principles of musical tension and release. For example, in a jazz song with swung 4/4 time, a piano player might play a polyrhythmic figure of dotted quarter notes to induce excitement underneath an improvised solo. This two against three polyrhythm is a common one: a hemiola.

The 'iola' walker system is a medium for writing music to be played back while the listener is walking. Musicians record songs with a walking listener in mind, imagining typical walking paces while playing improvised parts. Multiple versions of the same song are recorded with a variety of underlying polyrhythmic pulses.

A listener goes for a walk, and the Iola Walker app detects their walking pace. The iola walker app plays the next segment of the song with underlying polyrhythms closest to the listenerâ€™s walking pace. Iola Walker picks up footfalls using a foot-mounted accelerometer, processing the signals in real time using a recurrent neural network in an android app. The android app outputs a midi event for each footfall.
